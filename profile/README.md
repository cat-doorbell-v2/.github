The Cat Doorbell Version 2 is a Raspberry Pi-based system designed to alert when a cat wants to enter the house, addressing the issue of cats waiting outside unnoticed. This upgraded version incorporates both audio and visual detection to reduce false alarms, improving upon the solely sound-based detection of Version 1. The device passively listens for cat meows, activating a camera (and an LED strip in low light) upon detection. If a cat is identified within 45 seconds, a text message alert is sent out. This process involves a small state machine logic, integrating TensorFlow applications for sound and sight object recognition. Text alerts are facilitated through AWS services or an alternative such as Pushover for REST API-based messaging. The hardware setup includes a weatherproof Raspberry Pi 4B setup, a junction box with a plexiglass door for camera visibility, a microphone, a light sensor for LED strip control, and USB connections for the camera and microphone. The guide provides a detailed parts list, wiring diagram, and images to assist in the assembly and setup of the system, offering a fun and geeky solution to ensuring pets are not left waiting outside.
